 kubelet - It is kind of a agent which makes sure containers are running over the cluster as expected.

2 types of server - MASTER and Worker Node

MASTER - 					Worker Node - 
 - Kube-apiserver			 - Kubelet
 - etcd					 - container runtime - docker
 - controller
 - schedular 
-------------------
kubectl - command line utility, manager k8 activities with this

few command - 
 - kubectl run hello-minikube - use to deploy an app on cluster
